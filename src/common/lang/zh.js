    'decentralized, dynamic, safe, shared and owned by the community. NKN intend to introduce Cellular Automata to ' +
    'innovate on several major layers in the entire stack. First of all, the project will address the network ' +
    'decentralization in a broad sense, starting from application connectivity, to networking protocol. ' +
    'Secondly, the project intend to improve the underlying blockchain technology to achieve efficient and fair ' +
    'consensus without sacrificing node equality and decentralization. Finally the project will leverage blockchain ' +
    'to maximize network resource utilization and incentivize community driven network creation, participation and expansion.'
